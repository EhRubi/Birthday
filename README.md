A person wants to reduce the number of candles to be used to celebrate their birthday.
To achieve this, the person is going to set their new age in binary.
Each candle will represent one bit, and the candle will be lit to represent a 1, or extinguished to indicate a 0.
As a result, not only will she use far fewer candles, they won't even have to light them all!
The person is so confident that she will finally be able to blow out all the candles that they are even determined to put their age in seconds.
